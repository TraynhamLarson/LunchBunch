<h1>LunchBunch: Expanding your Social Palate, One Bite at a Time</h1>

<h3>What do you bring to the table?</h3>
<p>LunchBunch was designed with one thing in mind: bringing social networking back to the table.</p>

<p>Our goal is to revitalize the community, connection, and conversation that happen over everything from coffee to carnitas.</p>

<h3>Dining #nofilters</h3>
<p>Remember when it was more meaningful to sit down and talk about your dining experience instead of just posting a picture of it on social media? We do. We miss that!</p>

<p>LunchBunch aims to utilize the power of social networking to create a fusion between the old and the new - creating an easy way to safely communicate with other diners in your area looking to share a bite to eat.</p>
